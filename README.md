# Resource List


## Overview
Through out my college education we learned about famous Graphic Designers like Stefan Sagmeister, Milton Glaser, and Chip Kidd, to name a few. When I graduated in 2013 with a BFA in Graphic Design I was excited to start working but I wanted to continue to learn and be inspired but I didn't know where to start.

Over the years I have sifted through many different websites, resources, podcasts, and people that do great work and are very inspiring to follow.

*I am also learning markdown formatting in the process.*
